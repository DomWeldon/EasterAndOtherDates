# List of all Easter Dates from 1700 to 2299

A handy list for anyone doing any date analysis who needs a historical (and future) list of the movable holidays:

* Easter Sunday
* Easter Saturday
* Maundy Thursday
* Ash Wednesday (first day of lent)
* Shrove Tuesday (pancake day)
* Whit Sunday

## Files

* `all_easter_dates.csv`, contains all Easter Sunday dates (couresty of http://tlarsen2.tripod.com/anthonypolumbo/apeasterdates.html)
* `dateprocesser.py` is a python script which takes the first file and calculates the dates presented in...
* `all_easter_dates.csv`

Feel free to fork or take with or without attribution, and be thankful that we no longer use "3 days before Whitsunday 1867" as a way of recording when something happened.
